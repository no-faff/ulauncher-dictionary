### 2. Install a dictionary

#### Free dictionaries

**GCIDE (GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English)** - free, comprehensive English dictionary. Download the StarDict files from [dict.org mirrors](https://ftp.dict.org/pub/dict/).

**Wiktionary exports** - community-maintained, regularly updated:

- [dictinfo.com](https://www.dictinfo.com/) (English Wiktionary in StarDict format)
- [Vuizur/Wiktionary-Dictionaries](https://github.com/Vuizur/Wiktionary-Dictionaries) on GitHub

**CC-CEDICT** - the standard free Chinese-English dictionary, widely available in StarDict format.

**JMDict/EDICT** - the standard free Japanese-English dictionary.

**FreeDict** - open-source bilingual dictionaries for many language pairs at [freedict.org](https://freedict.org/).

#### Commercial dictionaries

StarDict versions of well-known commercial dictionaries can be found online. Dicky works with all of them. Some popular ones people use:

| Language | Dictionaries |
|---|---|
| English | Chambers, Collins, Oxford, Longman, Cambridge |
| English (American) | Merriam-Webster, American Heritage |
| Spanish | Collins Spanish-English, Oxford Spanish-English, VOX |

#### Where to put them

Place dictionary files in `~/.stardict/dic/`. Each dictionary lives in its own subfolder containing `.ifo`, `.idx` and `.dict` (or `.dict.dz`) files.

```
~/.stardict/dic/
  my-dictionary/
    My_Dictionary.ifo
    My_Dictionary.idx
    My_Dictionary.dict.dz
```

### 3. Verify sdcv works

```bash
sdcv "hello"
```

If this shows a definition, you're good.
